This is because they are undertaking a greater risk of paying the entire policy before the customer has invested more than the policy's worth. Therefore, life insurance companies use one's life expectancy to set the pricing of life insurance policies (Social Security, 2019). If there is a huge gap between your age and your life expectancy, there is a lower risk for the insurance company and the policy will be set at a cheaper price."
