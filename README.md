- **Wednesday** (2nd Nov): First Draft of Proposal
- **Thursday** (3rd Nov): Discuss changes and submit on Thurs Night or Friday Morning

### Research Question: Determining which factors predicts one's' life expectancy the best (using forward/ backward generative models, and then perform prediction of life expectancy using regression model.)   
1. Life Expectancy vs Whatever Factors
2. Additive/ Interaction model, multicollinearity
3. Prediction using Linear Model
4. Testing performance of model using training vs testing dataset

> What are the predicting variables actually affecting the life expectancy?
